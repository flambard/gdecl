# gdecl

gdecl is a framework for programming [Godot](https://godotengine.org) 4 with Common Lisp, using [Embeddable Common Lisp](https://ecl.common-lisp.dev) (ECL). Your Lisp code is compiled into a GDExtension library. A small C bootstrap boots ECL inside Godot, and from then on everything is done from Lisp: it looks up the GDExtension interface functions, registers classes, methods, properties and signals, and handles Godot's callbacks.

gdecl is a proof of concept. Its API is incomplete and will change.

## Goals

GDExtension is a low-level C interface, not meant to be used directly by application developers. gdecl builds higher-level, Lisp-style APIs on top of it, step by step, with the aim of making Godot as easy to program in Lisp as in GDScript or C#, and taking inspiration from both. Since Godot is mostly used for games, the higher-level APIs must stay efficient: work such as looking up methods is done once rather than per call, and code called every frame shouldn't allocate.

The lower layers stay available, so you can drop down to them for what the higher ones don't cover yet, or for performance-critical code.

The long-term idea is to integrate Godot's classes with CLOS: define Godot classes with `defclass`-like forms, implement virtual methods such as `_process` with `defmethod`, and use generated Lisp classes for Godot's own classes. This would probably be a third package, built on `gd-extension`.

## Requirements

- Godot ≥ 4.4
- ECL, with `ecl-config` on `PATH`
- GNU Make and a C compiler (clang is used if it's installed)

## Setting up an application

An application is a directory with gdecl in it (for example as a git submodule), its own ASDF system and a Godot project:

```
my-app/
  gdecl/              this framework
  lisp/my-app.asd     your ASDF system
  lisp/*.lisp
  project/            your Godot project
  Makefile
```

**The ASDF system** depends on `gdecl`:

```lisp
(defsystem "my-app"
  :depends-on ("gdecl")
  :components ((:file "packages")
               (:file "my-app" :depends-on ("packages"))))
```

**The entry point.** Your code is loaded when Godot loads the extension, but it can't call Godot yet at that point. Register a function to run once gdecl is set up. This is where you register your classes:

```lisp
(defun start ()
  ...)

(gdext:add-initialize-hook 'start)
```

**The Makefile** names your ASDF system and the GDExtension library to build into your Godot project, and includes gdecl's make rules:

```make
SYSTEM = my-app
LIBRARY = project/bin/libgdecl.so
include gdecl/gdecl.mk
```

`gdecl.mk` also takes `LISP_DIRS`, the directories with your `.asd` and `.lisp` files (default `lisp`), `BUILD_DIR`, where the object files go (default `build/gdecl`), `GODOT`, the Godot executable (default `godot`), and the usual `CC` and `CFLAGS` (default clang if installed, and `-O0 -g`).

**The `.gdextension` file** in your Godot project points Godot to the library. The entry symbol is always `gdecl_library_init`:

```ini
[configuration]

entry_symbol = "gdecl_library_init"
compatibility_minimum = "4.4"

[libraries]
linux.debug = "res://bin/libgdecl.so"
```

## Building

```sh
make             # Compile the Lisp code into application.a and build the GDExtension library
make godot-api   # Regenerate the Godot API files, e.g. after upgrading Godot
make clean
```

The first `make` runs Godot once to dump `gdextension_interface.h` and `extension_api.json` into `gdecl/`.

## Packages

- **`gd-extension`** (nickname `gdext`): the Lisp-style API.
  - `add-initialize-hook` registers your entry point.
  - `with-string-name` and `with-string` create Godot StringNames and Strings, and destroy them again.
  - `get-method-bind` looks up a Godot method, so you can call it with `object-method-bind-ptrcall`.
  - `bind-method`, `bind-property` and `bind-signal-1` register your class's methods, properties and signals. Bound methods can take and return `bool`, `int` and `float`.
  - `cast-pointer`, `foreign-ref` and `clear-foreign-object` help with foreign memory.
- **`gd-extension-ffi`** (nickname `gdext-ffi`): the GDExtension C interface, mapped one-to-one. It contains the interface functions (`classdb-register-extension-class2`, `object-method-bind-ptrcall`, …), the enums (`+variant-type-float+`, …) and Lisp mirrors of the C structs. Use it for anything the `gd-extension` package doesn't cover yet.
